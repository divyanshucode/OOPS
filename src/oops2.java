//package is like a folder help us in comparmentalized folders
//e.g. com.divyanshu is a package , if you want to create a two classes of same name lets say greeting
//it wont allow you to do so
//but on the another hand, you can create a new package lets say A and B and can put each greeting function on
//A and B respectively

//it resolves the concern of class names collide
